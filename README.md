# MultiplayerFPS
This is the source code for a personal project made using Unreal Engine 4. It aims to replicate the likes of Multiplayer First Person Shooters such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Valorant, to name a few.

Please see that although the repository contains the Blueprints and the Maps associated, it contains none of the actual assets used. This is because of the size of the assets. As mentioned above, this repository focuses primarily on the source code.

Feel free to reach out if this project has been of any assistance to you as a reference or otherwise, if you would like to discuss about game development and design with a fellow practitioner, or if you would like to just make a contact in the field.
